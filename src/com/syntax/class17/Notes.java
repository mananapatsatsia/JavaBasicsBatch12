	//Variables-there are 3 types of variables in java:
		//Local, Instance and Static.
	//Local-variable defined inside the block of code.
	//Instance- variable defined outside of the method ,but inside the class.
    //Static-variable declared inside the class and has a static keyword before it.
	/*Class Vars{
int age=10; //instance variable
static double weight=25.5; //static
void method(){
String name="Moreed"; //local variable

}

}

local variables:
if a variable is defined inside a method or loop or switch or any other block
of code it is called local variable.
Instance variables:
if a variable is not declared inside a method but it is inside a class then
it is called an instance variable.
Static variable:
if a variable is not declared inside a method but it is inside a class and
it has static keyword with it then
it is called a static variable.
When to use which type of variable:
Local variables:
Local variables should always be preferred over instance and static variables
why because they occupy the computers' memory for very, very short amount of time
as soon as their purpose is served Java destroys them.
Pros:
save memory
cons:
not accessible outside of methods/block of code
Instance Variable:
when we want to share something in multiple methods of a class and the information is
expected to be different from object to object we should go with instance variables
Pros:
accessible in all the methods of a class
Cons:
occupy the computers' memory for longer than local variables.
