public class Methods {
	//Method it is a block of code or set of instructions that are executed when we call a method.
//2 main types of methods:
	//predefined(built-in) and user defined:--predefined methods are the methods created by java guys, they are part of jdk, like nextInt method.
	//User defined methods are the methods that are created by us.
	// steps to define a method:
	
	void addTwoNumber(int num1, int num2) {
		}
	
	//steps to define a method:
		//1) return type:
	   //for example in above case void is a return type that means that method does not return any data, it can just execute some
	//logic or can print something on the console.
	//other examples of written type are int String double etc. Basically we can return all data type from a method even the objects and arrays.
	//2)method name:
	//addTwoNumber - is the method name in above example.
	//3)Method header: void addTwoNumber(int num1, int num2) is called method header
	//4)addTwoNumber(int num1, int num2) is called method signature
	//5)(int num1, int num2) is called a parameter list the input to the method. all the data type that we can return from a method we can also take that as 
	//input in the form of parameter.
	//6){
	//return num1+num2;} -is called the method body that contains the logic that is executed when we call a method.
	//7) syntax to call a method: Methods obj=new Methods();
	                            //obj.ddTwoNumber(10,12);
	//8)return is a keyword that we use to return the data from a method in above example we are returning the sum of the numbers.
